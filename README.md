This repository contains a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) implementation for solving the Lunar Lander environment
from OpenAI's Gymnasium. The agent was trained using advanced reinforcement learning techniques such as
experience replay, target networks, and epsilon-greedy action selection.

The goal of this project is to create an agent that successfully lands the Lunar Lander with minimal fuel consumption while avoiding crashes. 

The model was trained to reach an average score of **200**, solving the environment in approximately **664** episodes.
